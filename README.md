Implementation of DL models (Tandem Neural Networks and Conditional Generative Adversarial Netowkrs) for photonic surface inverse design used for comparison with the Multi-fidelity (MF) ensemble approach that is found in https://github.com/lukagrbcic/MFEnsemblePhotonicSurfaces and https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01471.

The dataset used to train the models can be downloaded at:  https://osf.io/dwgtf/
The dataset details are given in the MF ensemble github repository: https://github.com/lukagrbcic/MFEnsemblePhotonicSurfaces
